# Classes for GenEd and specific major

# same class can occur on different days and time
# validation to make sure overlapping classes cannot be taken at the same time

# Lee task: create functions that show available classes for each major if input = major
# ex: if input == specific_major:
  # specific_major_classes()
  # majors: computer science, engineering, astronomy
    # four classes per major (to start out)
# create lists of each class, list for student schedule (ability to append classes into list, error for adding class not in major)

  # print formatted list with name of classes and time
# all majors will have gen ed classes, include gen_ed list as part of each specified major list
